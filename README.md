# etranhoac-data-scientist-project


In project 1, given the time constraint, I wanted to stick to a simple, interpretable algorithm (linear regression) paired with deliberate model specification and feature engineering.


In project 2 I followed these steps:

1. Calculate player season metrics (per 100)
2. Calculate Z-scores of these metrics
3. Create a composite score of Z-scores
4. Pick out the most interesting players
5. Visualize with bar charts
